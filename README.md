# YOLO Model for Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease Virus (CSSVD) Detection in Android


## Description

This project deploys the YOLO v5 model for accurate and real-time detection of Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease Virus (CSSVD) in cocoa crops. The Android app offers user-friendly disease identification and management support.

## Features

- YOLO Model Integration: Utilizes the YOLO v5 model trained on a CSSVD dataset.
- Real-time Detection: Achieves rapid CSSVD detection directly on Android devices.
- User-friendly Interface: Intuitive app interface for image capture and analysis.
- Alerts and Recommendations: Provides disease alerts and management suggestions.
- Sustainable Agriculture: Empowers farmers with timely interventions for healthy cocoa production.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
4. Capture images for CSSVD detection and view results.

## Usage

1. Launch the app and navigate to the detection screen.
2. Capture images of cocoa leaves.
3. Receive real-time detection results and recommendations.
